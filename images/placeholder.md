# Image Placeholder Requirements

To complete the landing page, you'll need the following images:

1. `hero-app-mockup.png` - A screenshot or mockup of the FitCal app showing the nutrition tracking screen (approximately 400px x 800px)

2. `app-showcase.png` - A mockup showing multiple screens of the app features (approximately 600px x 400px)

3. `app-devices.png` - A mockup showing the app on multiple devices like phone, tablet, and smartwatch (approximately 600px x 400px)

4. `testimonial-1.jpg`, `testimonial-2.jpg`, `testimonial-3.jpg` - Profile images for testimonials (50px x 50px, round crop)

## Instructions

1. Replace these placeholder images with actual images before launching the site
2. Make sure all images are optimized for web (compressed)
3. Use appropriate alt text for accessibility
4. Keep consistent style/look across all images

For quick testing, you can use image placeholders from services like:
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- [Picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/)

Example usage:
```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x800" alt="FitCal App Screenshot">
```
